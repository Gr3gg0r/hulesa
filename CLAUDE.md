# CLAUDE.md — hulesa

> Project memory for Claude Code. It describes the project architecture, conventions, and workflows. The project uses English for all code comments and documentation. hulesa is developed Claude-first: this is the single source of agent guidance — do not add other agent instruction files (AGENTS.md, .cursorrules, etc.).

---

## Project Overview

`hulesa` is an Electron desktop application that ingests MP4 (and other FFmpeg-compatible) video files, converts them to multi-bitrate HLS, and uploads the generated assets to an S3-compatible object store.

The philosophy is deliberately straightforward: running a server just to convert video to HLS is an unnecessary burden. Conversion happens locally on the user's machine (bundled FFmpeg), producing a proper adaptive HLS stream (master manifest + renditions), which is then uploaded directly to the user's chosen S3-compatible endpoint. No transcoding backend, no third-party service in the middle.

The app has three views, switched from the header:

- **Simple** (default): a 3-step wizard — drop a video, pick renditions, choose a destination (local folder or S3), convert.
- **Advanced**: the original two operation modes:
  - **Single file**: Convert and upload one video with live progress feedback.
  - **Folder batch**: Scan a folder, queue multiple videos, and process them with configurable concurrency.
- **History**: review past jobs, search by filename, filter by status, copy manifest URLs in bulk, and delete entries.

## Build & Development Commands

All commands run through `pnpm`. Scripts that set `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` go through `cross-env` so they work in cmd.exe on Windows as well as POSIX shells — keep that prefix when adding scripts with inline env vars.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development (Electron main + Vite renderer dev server + preload watcher)
pnpm run dev

# Dev against different environment files
pnpm run dev:slow        # loads .env.slow (Toxiproxy slow endpoint)
pnpm run dev:testing     # loads .env.testing
pnpm run dev:staging     # loads .env.staging
pnpm run dev:production  # loads .env.production

# Production build (outputs to dist/main, dist/preload, dist/renderer)
pnpm run build

# Preview the production build locally
pnpm run preview

# Lint TypeScript sources
pnpm run lint            # eslint . (flat config, type-aware)

# Type-check everything (main, preload, renderer, shared, tests)
pnpm run typecheck       # tsc -p tsconfig.typecheck.json --noEmit

# Format with Prettier
pnpm run format          # prettier --write .

# Tests
pnpm run test            # Vitest unit + renderer suites (no external services)
pnpm run test:watch      # Watch mode
pnpm run test:integration  # Full suite: real FFmpeg + live RustFS (needs docker compose up -d)

# Landing page (docs/) — rebuild after editing docs/index.html or docs/src/landing.css
pnpm run docs:css          # tailwindcss -i docs/src/landing.css -o docs/assets/landing.css --minify
```

## Testing

Vitest 4 is configured in `vitest.config.ts`:

- **Unit tests** (`tests/main/**`, `tests/renderer/**`) run in plain Node/jsdom. The `electron` module is aliased to `tests/mocks/electron.ts` (plain `require("electron")` in Node returns a binary path, not the API). `tests/setup.ts` points `HULESA_TEST_USER_DATA` at a fresh temp dir per test file so the `historyService` singleton stays isolated.
- **Integration tests** (`tests/integration/**`) are excluded unless `HULESA_TEST_INTEGRATION=1` (set by `pnpm run test:integration`). They need the RustFS stack up (`docker compose up -d`); override the endpoint with `S3_TEST_ENDPOINT_URL` when using alternate ports. Each suite creates its own bucket and cleans up after itself. They self-skip when the endpoint is unreachable.
- Internal helpers in the services are exported specifically for unit tests (e.g. `determineVariantProfiles`, `createMasterManifest`, `convertToHls`, `normalizePrefix`, `deriveObjectKey`, `parseEndpoint`). Keep these exports stable; tests import them directly.
- Test files are type-checked through `tsconfig.node.json` (`tests/**/*.ts`) and `tsconfig.renderer.json` (`tests/renderer`) — new test directories must be added to the matching tsconfig include or ESLint's type-aware parser will reject them.
- The bundled FFmpeg/FFprobe binaries may lack the execute bit after installs that skip package scripts; integration tests `chmod 0o755` them in `beforeAll`, mirroring `prepareBinaries()`.

## Environment Configuration

**End users configure everything in the app's settings UI** — endpoint, region, bucket, credentials, path-style, public/view base URLs, and upload concurrency all live in `settings.json` inside the Electron `userData` directory (see `settingsService.ts`; secrets are encrypted via `safeStorage`). There is no `.env.example` to copy and no env-file setup for running the app.

Environment variables still exist as a **dev-preset fallback**: the main process loads `dotenv/config` at startup, and the `dev:*` scripts inject preset files via `dotenv-cli` (e.g. `pnpm run dev:slow` loads `.env.slow` for the Toxiproxy endpoint). Saved UI settings always win over env vars (`configureS3` in `minioClient.ts`; `getUploadConcurrency` in `videoPipeline.ts`).

| Variable                     | Purpose                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `S3_REGION`                  | Region identifier (e.g., `us-east-1`)                      |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`           | S3 access key                                              |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`       | S3 secret key                                              |
| `S3_BUCKET_NAME`             | Target bucket                                              |
| `S3_ENDPOINT_URL`            | S3 API base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:9000` for RustFS) |
| `S3_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT` | `true` for self-hosted path-style stores (RustFS, MinIO)   |
| `S3_BUCKET_URL`              | Base URL used to construct public links                    |
| `S3_VIEW_ENDPOINT`           | Optional CDN or view base for manifests                    |
| `S3_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY`      | Parallel upload workers (default 4, max 16)                |

The renderer currently reads no env vars — all S3 configuration is consumed in the main process. If a future variable is needed in React code, expose it via `loadEnv` + a `renderer.define` entry in `electron.vite.config.ts`.

---

## Local Development Stack (Docker)

A RustFS server and optional Toxiproxy are provided via `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Services:

- **RustFS** on `http://localhost:9000` (API) and `http://localhost:9001` (Console) — Apache-2.0 S3-compatible store, drop-in local replacement for MinIO
- **Toxiproxy** on `http://localhost:8474` (API) and `http://localhost:8666` (proxied S3)
- **s3-bootstrap** (AWS CLI) auto-creates the bucket and applies a public-read policy
- **toxiproxy-bootstrap** adds latency (400ms ± 120ms jitter) and bandwidth limits (50kbps) to simulate slow networks

Default credentials: `rustfsadmin / rustfsadmin`.

---

## Architecture Details

### Electron Process Model

- **Main process** (`src/main/index.ts`): Creates the `BrowserWindow`, registers `ipcMain` handlers, and delegates all heavy work to services.
- **Preload** (`src/preload/index.ts`): Exposes a single typed `window.api` object via `contextBridge`. No Node APIs leak into the renderer.
- **Renderer** (`src/renderer/src/App.tsx`): React SPA that communicates only through `window.api`. The header switches between three views persisted in localStorage (`hulesa-view`): **Simple** (the `JourneyWizard` 3-step flow), **Advanced** (the original single/batch UI behind a secondary toggle), and **History**.
- The main process takes `app.requestSingleInstanceLock()` at startup; a second instance quits immediately and focuses the existing window (a second instance would otherwise sweep the first instance's live temp dirs and race history writes).

Window settings:

- `nodeIntegration: false`
- `contextIsolation: true`
- `sandbox: true` (the preload only uses `ipcRenderer`/`contextBridge`, which work sandboxed — keep it that way)

The preload bundle must keep `require("electron")` external — if the electron npm shim gets inlined, `window.api` silently disappears and the renderer shows "Native bridge unavailable". electron-vite 5 force-sets `ssr.noExternal: true` for preloads, which under Vite 8 (rolldown) overrides `rollupOptions.external`; the config therefore re-externalizes electron via `preload.ssr.external: ["electron"]` in `electron.vite.config.ts`. After touching the build config, verify `dist/preload/index.cjs` starts with `require("electron")`.

### IPC Contracts

All IPC payloads are defined in `src/shared/ipc.ts`. The `ExposedBridge` interface and the global `Window` extension must stay in sync with the preload script and main handlers.

Key channels:

- `dialog:select-video` / `dialog:select-folder`
- `jobs:scan-folder` / `jobs:queue` / `jobs:process-single` / `jobs:control` / `jobs:set-concurrency`
- `jobs:single-progress` (renderer → main push for single-file mode)
- `jobs:update` / `jobs:log` (main → renderer push for batch mode)
- `history:list` / `history:delete`
- `settings:get` / `settings:save` (S3 connection settings; secrets stay main-side, the renderer only sees `hasAccessKey`/`hasSecretKey`)
- `settings:save-profile` / `settings:delete-profile` / `settings:apply-profile` (named saved connections; applying copies a profile over the active settings and reconfigures the S3 client)

`SUPPORTED_VIDEO_EXTENSIONS` is exported from `src/shared/ipc.ts` and shared by the main-process queue validation and the renderer DropZone. `jobs:process-single` accepts an optional `destination` (`{ type: "s3" }` or `{ type: "local", directory }`); local jobs skip the upload and return the manifest file path in `manifestUrl`.

### Video Pipeline (`videoPipeline.ts`)

1. **Probe**: FFprobe reads width, height, duration, frame rate.
2. **Filter renditions**: Skips profiles taller than the source. Falls back to the largest fitting profile if none match.
3. **Encode variants**: FFmpeg encodes each variant to HLS (TS segments + `index.m3u8`).
4. **Master manifest**: A `master.m3u8` is generated with `BANDWIDTH`, `RESOLUTION`, `FRAME-RATE`, and `CODECS` attributes.
5. **Upload or copy**: Files are streamed to S3 with a configurable worker pool, or copied to the chosen local folder when the job destination is `{ type: "local" }` (no S3 client is created on that path).
6. **Cleanup**: Temp directory is deleted on every exit path (encode failures included); orphaned `hulesa-hls-*` dirs are also swept from `os.tmpdir()` at startup.

Variant profiles range from 240p to 4K with x264 presets (`veryfast`), AAC audio, and 6-second HLS segments.

Cancellation threads an `AbortSignal` through probe, encode (execa `cancelSignal` — execa 9 silently ignores the plain `signal` option), and upload (in-flight read streams are destroyed). Canceled or failed jobs may leave partial objects in the bucket by design: re-running the same file and prefix derives the same object key and overwrites, so no best-effort S3 cleanup runs on failure (it could destroy a previously successful upload at the same key).

### Job Manager (`jobManager.ts`)

- Maintains an ordered queue of `InternalJob` objects.
- Supports concurrency 1–16 (default 2).
- Deduplicates against the history store: if a `(filePath, basePrefix)` pair was already completed, the job is skipped.
- Unsupported extensions are skipped immediately.
- Power-save blocker is refcounted: the batch queue holds it while active and each single-file conversion holds its own, so overlapping holds never switch each other off.
- Overlapping `processSingle` calls for the same `(filePath, basePrefix)` are rejected — they would derive the same object key and clobber each other's output.
- Queue controls: `pause`, `resume`, `cancel-current`, `cancel-remaining`, `clear-completed`. `cancel-current` aborts the running FFmpeg process and in-flight uploads via an `AbortController` threaded through `processVideoJob`.

### History Service (`historyService.ts`)

- Persists to `history.json` inside the Electron `userData` directory. Writes are atomic (temp file + rename); an unreadable store is moved aside to `history.json.corrupt-<timestamp>` for manual recovery before a fresh store is written.
- Stores jobs (capped at 2000 records) and per-job logs (capped at 5000 log entries globally). Log writes are debounced (1s) to avoid main-thread stalls during long batches; job state transitions save immediately and `flush()` runs on app quit. At startup, records left in an active state by a previous crash are marked failed ("Interrupted by app restart").
- Supports search (filename, path, prefix) and status filtering.

### Settings Service (`settingsService.ts`)

- Persists S3 connection settings to `settings.json` inside the Electron `userData` directory. Writes are atomic (temp file + rename); a stored file with a missing or malformed `secrets` block is ignored instead of crashing startup.
- Secrets are encrypted at rest via `safeStorage` when the OS keychain is available, with an honest plaintext fallback (`getView().encryptionAvailable` tells the renderer which mode is active).
- Empty secret fields on save mean "keep the stored value". The renderer-facing view only exposes `hasAccessKey` / `hasSecretKey` — raw secrets never cross IPC.
- Undecryptable secrets (lost keychain entry) are treated as unset with a warning instead of crashing startup.
- Named saved connections live in a `profiles` array alongside the active `s3` block (each profile holds a full settings block with its own encrypted secrets). The active `s3` block stays the single source of truth consumed by the S3 client and pipeline. `saveProfile` upserts by id (empty secrets keep that profile's stored values), `deleteProfile` removes, and `applyProfile` deep-copies a profile over the active block — applying is a server-side copy, so secrets still never cross IPC. Load validation accepts the `s3` block and the `profiles` array independently, dropping malformed entries.
- Saved connections surface in two places: the settings modal (select + Load/Delete, plus a "Save as connection" name field — same-name saves overwrite) and the wizard destination step (a picker shown only when profiles exist; choosing one applies it and refills the non-secret fields).

### S3 Client (`minioClient.ts`)

- Uses the `minio` npm package, but works with any S3-compatible endpoint; local development targets RustFS.
- `ensureBucket` creates the bucket if missing and applies a public-read policy (skipped when the user disables public read in settings).
- `buildPublicUrl` constructs URLs from view endpoint → bucket URL fallback.
- `configureS3(settings)` applies saved settings at runtime (called at startup and on `settings:save`); non-empty fields win over env vars and the cached client is reset. `getActiveBucketName()` resolves the bucket with the same precedence.

---

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Formatter**: Prettier (semicolons, double quotes, trailing commas, 100 print width, 2-space tabs).
- **Linter**: ESLint flat config with TypeScript, React, and React Hooks rules.
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled. `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, and `noImplicitReturns` are enforced. Unused variables will fail compilation.
- **Imports**: Use path aliases (`@renderer/*`, `@shared/*`).
- **Renderer imports**: `@renderer` resolves to `src/renderer/src`.
- **File naming**: kebab-case for configs, camelCase for source files.

### React Conventions in App.tsx

- Single large functional component (`App`) with many `useState`/`useEffect` hooks; the Simple journey lives in `components/JourneyWizard.tsx` and talks to `window.api` directly. S3 connection settings are editable from two places that share the same field set: the wizard's destination step and the global settings modal (`isSettingsOpen` in App.tsx, opened from the header gear in every view — the only settings entry point in Advanced/History). The modal refetches `settings:get` on open so wizard saves in the same session are reflected.
- Theme is user-selectable via `useTheme()` (`"system" | "light" | "dark"`, localStorage key `hulesa-theme`); `"system"` tracks OS `prefers-color-scheme: dark` live. Modals use `useDialogA11y()` for focus trapping, ESC close, and focus restore.
- The UI follows an Apple glassmorphism design language on a shot.so-style gradient mesh: the app root uses `.glass-canvas` (fixed radial-gradient blobs, per-theme in `index.css`), and panels are frosted glass (`.linear-card` — `backdrop-filter: blur(24px) saturate(180%)`, translucent per-theme backgrounds, 16px radii, soft diffused shadows). Reusable component classes (`linear-card`, `linear-well`, `linear-btn*`, `linear-input`, `linear-select`, `linear-label`, `linear-hint`, `linear-badge*`, `linear-table`, `linear-thead`, `linear-segmented`, `linear-progress`, `linear-alert*`, `linear-mono`, `linear-dropzone`) live in `@layer components` in `src/renderer/src/index.css`; glass/translucent values are scoped via `[data-theme="hulesa"]` / `[data-theme="hulesadark"]` selectors, while accent-driven values reference DaisyUI 5 CSS variables (`var(--color-…)`). Prefer these classes over raw DaisyUI component classes (`btn`, `card`, `badge`, `table`, `alert`) when touching the renderer; only `card-body` (padding) and `checkbox checkbox-sm` (restyled globally) remain in use. New translucent surfaces must NOT use solid `bg-base-*` — glass only reads against the gradient canvas.
- Typography is Inter, loaded via `@fontsource/inter` imports in `src/renderer/src/main.tsx` (400/500/600/700), with Tailwind utilities used inline for one-off tweaks; there are no separate CSS modules for components.

---

## Security Considerations

1. **CSP**: `index.html` sets a strict Content-Security-Policy (`default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:`).
2. **No remote content**: The renderer does not load remote scripts or iframes.
3. **Context isolation**: Preload runs in an isolated context; only `window.api` is exposed.
4. **Sandbox enabled**: `sandbox: true` — the preload must stick to `ipcRenderer`/`contextBridge` only. Never expose raw `ipcRenderer` or Node-capable APIs through `window.api`.
5. **S3 credentials**: Entered in the app's settings UI and stored in `settings.json` under the Electron `userData` directory, encrypted via `safeStorage` when the OS keychain is available. Env vars are dev presets only: all `.env*` files are gitignored except `.env.slow`, which is intentionally tracked and contains only local RustFS/Toxiproxy defaults. Never commit credentials.
6. **Bucket policy**: The app applies a public-read policy to the target bucket by default so streams play without signed URLs. The destination-step toggle lets the user disable this (with an in-UI warning about whole-bucket exposure when it's on); ensure the default is acceptable for your deployment.
7. **Temp files**: HLS artifacts are written to `os.tmpdir()` and cleaned up on every job exit path; any orphans from a crash are swept at the next startup.

## Adding Features / Common Tasks

### Adding a new IPC channel

1. Add request/response types to `src/shared/ipc.ts`.
2. Add the handler in `src/main/index.ts` using `ipcMain.handle(...)`.
3. Expose the method in `src/preload/index.ts` inside the `api` object.
4. Consume it in `src/renderer/src/App.tsx` via `window.api`.

### Adding a new env var to the renderer

Vite does not automatically expose `process.env` to the renderer, and the renderer currently reads none. If a variable is ever needed in React code:

1. Load it in `electron.vite.config.ts` using `loadEnv` (re-add the `({ mode })` param).
2. Add a `renderer.define` entry so it is replaced at build time.

### Changing DaisyUI themes

Themes are defined CSS-first in `src/renderer/src/index.css` via `@plugin "daisyui/theme"` blocks (DaisyUI 5 has no JS theme config — there is no `tailwind.config.cjs`). Each block is a fully-specified token set (no theme inheritance). The palette is monochrome black & white, flipped between themes — only the status colors (info/success/warning/error) carry hue, and they are for badges/alerts only:

- Light: `hulesa` — white surfaces on a `#FAFAFA` base, `#0A0A0A` primary/content (`default: true`)
- Dark: `hulesadark` — `#141414` surfaces on a `#0A0A0A` base, `#FAFAFA` primary/content (`prefersdark: true`)

Both themes share the same radius/border tokens (`--radius-box: 1rem`, `--radius-field: 0.625rem`, `--radius-selector: 9999px`, `--border-field: 1px`). The `@theme` block in the same file registers Inter as `--font-sans`. The component classes in `index.css` read accent colors through DaisyUI 5 CSS variables (`var(--color-primary)`, `var(--color-base-content)`, etc. — the v4 `oklch(var(--p))` shorthand is gone) and glass translucency through `[data-theme="…"]` selectors, so changing a token in a theme block restyles the whole UI. The `.glass-canvas` blobs are grayscale and `.linear-progress` fills with solid `var(--color-primary)` — keep the monochrome constraint when adding surfaces.

The `<html>` tag in `index.html` defaults to `data-theme="hulesa"`, and `useTheme()` (`src/renderer/src/hooks/useTheme.ts`) applies `hulesa`/`hulesadark` based on the stored preference (System/Light/Dark toggle in the header). `src/renderer/public/theme-init.js` applies the same logic before React mounts so the first paint already has the right theme — keep the two in sync when changing the preference logic.

## Deployment Notes

- Packaging uses `electron-builder` with configuration in `electron-builder.yml` (`appId: com.hulesa.app`, macOS dmg/zip for arm64+x64, Windows nsis/portable, Linux AppImage/deb). Build with `pnpm run dist` (or `dist:mac` / `dist:win` / `dist:linux`); artifacts are written to `release/${version}/`, which is gitignored.
- The `@ffmpeg-installer`/`@ffprobe-installer` platform packages carry no `os`/`cpu` constraints, so pnpm installs every variant. They are declared as `optionalDependencies` (electron-builder only bundles declared deps on pnpm 10+), and `scripts/prune-platform-binaries.cjs` (an `afterPack` hook) strips all but the target platform+arch — keep both in place or bundles double in size. When bumping the installer packages, bump the `optionalDependencies` versions to match.
- `build/` holds the app icons used as `buildResources`: a monochrome play/stream mark matching the app palette — `icon.png` (1024px master, also used for Linux), `icon.icns` (macOS), and `icon.ico` (Windows).
- CI runs on GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): a `check` job (lint, typecheck, unit tests, production build) and an `integration` job that brings up the RustFS Docker stack and runs `pnpm run test:integration`.
- Releases are built by `.github/workflows/release.yml`: pushing a `v*` tag (or dispatching the workflow manually with an existing tag) builds all three desktop platforms in a matrix (macos-latest → `dist:mac`, windows-latest → `dist:win`, ubuntu-latest → `dist:linux`) and attaches the binaries to the matching GitHub release via `softprops/action-gh-release`. The `dist:*` scripts pass `--publish never` because electron-builder otherwise attempts implicit publishing on CI and fails without a `GH_TOKEN` — asset upload is the workflow's job. Artifacts are unsigned (`CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false` — no signing identities on CI), so the release notes must keep the macOS Gatekeeper / Windows SmartScreen caveats. The action appends assets and fails on duplicate names — delete existing assets for a tag before re-dispatching.
- The landing page is `docs/index.html`, served by GitHub Pages from `docs/` on `main` at `/<user>.github.io/hulesa/` (Pages project paths are case-sensitive — `/hulesa/` 404s) — all asset paths are relative so the project path works. It is plain HTML + a compiled stylesheet (`docs/assets/landing.css`, built from `docs/src/landing.css` via `pnpm run docs:css` — rerun after touching either, and commit the output); no other build step or CDN dependencies (Inter is self-hosted in `docs/fonts/`). The DaisyUI theme blocks and glass classes mirror `src/renderer/src/index.css` — keep the two files in sync when changing design tokens. The GitHub repo URL appears exactly once, as the `GITHUB_REPO` constant in the bottom inline script of `docs/index.html`; the Pages origin (`https://gr3gg0r.github.io/hulesa/`) is hardcoded in the canonical link, og/twitter URLs, the JSON-LD block, and `docs/sitemap.xml` — all need the same edit if the handle changes. An animated walkthrough of the Simple journey lives in `docs/index.html` (the `[data-demo]` section: class-toggled timeline in the bottom inline script, `.demo-*` styles in `docs/src/landing.css`, static final frame under `prefers-reduced-motion`). `docs/assets/journey-demo.gif` is a 14.4s palette-optimized capture of one loop, embedded in the README — regenerate by recording the `[data-demo]` element for one cycle (Playwright `recordVideo`, light scheme), cropping to its bounding box, then two-pass `palettegen`/`paletteuse` to GIF (mp4 embeds do NOT render as players in GitHub READMEs — only GIFs animate there). The `#download` section detects the visitor's OS (user-agent, with a mobile guard and best-effort Intel-Mac detection via `userAgentData`) and points the primary button at the matching asset from `api.github.com/repos/<repo>/releases/latest` at runtime — no per-release edits needed; on API failure the button falls back to the Releases page. The "Under the hood" badge carries the unit-test count (`Vitest · N tests`) by hand — bump it when the suite grows.

## Centralised homelab infrastructure

> ## Networking: Tailscale first
>
> **Every homelab service is reached over Tailscale, not the LAN.** Ports bind to
> the tailnet address (`100.76.45.102`), never `0.0.0.0` — they are invisible on
> `192.168.100.0/24` and on the internet. `ufw` cannot filter published Docker
> ports, so the bind address *is* the access control.
>
> Before anything else: `tailscale status` must list `homelab`.
>
> - **Do not** use `192.168.100.129` — that path is deliberately closed
> - **Do not** publish container ports to `0.0.0.0`
> - To share a hot-reloading dev server, bind `0.0.0.0` locally and hand out the
>   **MacBook's** tailnet address (`100.67.52.1`), not its LAN IP
>
> Authoritative reference: the **`homelab` repo** —
> [`docs/inventory.md`](../homelab/docs/inventory.md) for what runs where,
> [`docs/ports.md`](../homelab/docs/ports.md) before claiming any port,
> [`docs/shared-tech.md`](../homelab/docs/shared-tech.md) for tooling that
> already exists.


> Added 2026-08-03. The homelab was reinstalled on Pop!_OS; the old
> `192.168.100.129:52xx` dev services and the self-hosted Infisical are **gone**.
> Anything in this file referring to them is stale.

### Do not run your own Postgres, Redis, S3, or Mailpit

One shared instance of each runs on the homelab. This project has its own
database and namespace inside them — you do not need a local container.

| Service | Address | This project uses |
|---|---|---|
| Postgres 16 | `100.76.45.102:13000` | database `hulesa_dev`, user `devuser` |
| Redis 7 | `100.76.45.102:13001` | logical DB **6** |
| RustFS (S3) | `http://100.76.45.102:13002` | bucket `hulesa-dev` |
| Mailpit | `100.76.45.102:13005` (SMTP) | shared inbox, UI on `:13006` |

**Reachable over Tailscale only.** These ports are bound to the tailnet address,
not `0.0.0.0` — they are invisible on the LAN and the internet. Your machine must
be on the tailnet (`tailscale status` should list `homelab`).

Passwords live in the homelab repo, SOPS-encrypted:

```bash
sops --decrypt --input-type dotenv --output-type dotenv \
  ../homelab/stacks/dev-shared/dev.enc.env
```

### What belongs in Docker, and what does not

**Only infrastructure.** Applications run natively so hot reload works — putting
a dev server in a container turns every keystroke into a rebuild.

To preview a hot-reloading app on a phone or another device, bind to all
interfaces and use the **MacBook's** tailnet address (`100.67.52.1`):

```bash
pnpm exec vite --host 0.0.0.0     # NOT `pnpm dev -- --host` — the -- is passed literally
```

### Secrets: SOPS + age, not Infisical

Infisical ran on the homelab and was lost in the reinstall. It is not coming
back — it was a server, on a LUKS-encrypted laptop that cannot boot unattended,
which is the worst possible property for a secrets store.

Encrypted values now live in the repo and are committed. Only the values are
encrypted; key names stay readable so diffs show what changed.
Reference: `mkp/deploy/SOPS_SETUP.md`.

### Deploying this project

Deployed apps do **not** use the shared dev services. Each gets its own isolated
stack — own network, own Postgres and Redis, own Cloudflare Tunnel, no published
host ports. Reference implementation:
`mkp/services/mkp-v2-api/deploy/homelab/`.

### More

- `homelab/docs/shared-tech.md` — tooling that already exists across these repos
- `homelab/docs/inventory.md` — what runs on the host and who owns it
- `homelab/docs/ports.md` — check before publishing any port

## Continuous integration

> Audited 2026-08-04 across every repo. **This one: — passing.**
>
> **Public repo.** GitHub-hosted minutes are free and unlimited here, and a self-hosted runner must NEVER be attached — a fork's PR would execute arbitrary code on the homelab.

**Before touching a workflow here, read the standard:**
[`homelab/docs/ci.md`](../homelab/docs/ci.md).

The three rules that matter most:

1. **A red workflow nobody fixes is worse than none.** For each one, ask
   whether anyone acted the last time it failed. If not, delete it — that is a
   legitimate outcome, not a retreat.
2. **Local hooks already cover lint, typecheck, unit tests, and build.** CI
   should not duplicate them. It should do what hooks cannot: cross-repo
   contracts, deploys, scheduled audits, anything needing org secrets.
3. **macOS runners bill at 10x.** iOS jobs on every push are how a 2,000-minute
   allowance disappears. Move them to tags or `workflow_dispatch`.

Self-hosted runners on the homelab are **not** currently recommended — the
minute allowance is not binding, because CI fails in ~12 seconds rather than
because it is efficient. `homelab/docs/ci.md` covers when that changes.
